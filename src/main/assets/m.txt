in Geneva

On behalf of all at 
the Word Uyghur 
Congress (WUC), 
the Unrepresented 
Nations and Peoples 
Organization (UNPO) 
and the Society for 
Threatened Peoples 
(STP), Human 
Rights in China: 
Implications for 
East Turkestan, 
Tibet and 
Southern Mongolia 
In what was an 
unprecedented 
coming-together of 
leading Uyghur, 
Mongolian, Tibetan 
and Chinese 
activists, as well 
as other leading 
international 
experts, we were 
greatly humbled by 
the great 
enthusiasm, 
contribution and 
desire from all in 
attendance to make 
this occasion 
something 
meaningful, the 
outcome of which 
produced some 
concrete, 
action-orientated 
solutions to our 
shared grievances.
We are especially 
delighted about the 
platform and 
programme of work 
established in the 
declaration of the 
conference, upon 
which we sincerely 
hope will be built
 a strong and 
resolute working 
relationship 
on our shared goals 
for the future.
 With this in mind,
we thoroughly look 
forward to working 
with you on these 
matters.
